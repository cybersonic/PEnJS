PEnJS: Persistence Engine for JavaScript
With the increasing use of JavaScript as a language to develop client side applications, this framework is designed to enable you to retrieve and store objects as you would using an ORM on the server side. 

You can define the relationship of your objects in a configuration file, stating dependencies, one to many/one to one relationships, validations etc and then be able to get and save your objects easily. 

The code has not been optimised yet for HTML5 but work is in progress to clean up the code to make it work right for various local database implementations.
